Functionality

When using |recovery|, it is hard to tell, what has been changed between the
recovered file and the actual on disk version. The aim of this plugin is, to
have an easy way to see differences, between the recovered files and the files
stored on disk.

Therefore this plugin sets up an auto command, that will create a diff buffer
between the recovered file and the on-disk version of the same file. You can
easily see, what has been changed and save your recovered work back to the
file on disk.

By default this plugin is enabled. To disable it, use >
    :RecoverPluginDisable
<
To enable this plugin again, use >
    :RecoverPluginEnable
<
When you open a file and vim detects, that an |swap-file| already exists for a
buffer, the plugin will ask you, if you'd like to see a diff of both versions
using |vimdiff|. In the dialog answer 'Yes' to open the file and display a
diff version, 'No' to open the file normally, 'Abort' to show the normal Vim
swapfile dialog and 'Delete' to directly delete the swapfile. Note, that
'Delete' will only be displayed, if the swapfile and the on-disk version are
the same.

If you have said 'Yes', the plugin opens a new vertical splitt buffer. On the
left side, you'll find the file as it is stored on disk and the right side
will contain your recovered version of the file (using the found swap file).

You can now use the |merge| commands to copy the contents to the buffer that
holds your recovered version. If you are finished, you can close the diff
version and close the window, by issuing |:diffoff!| and |:close| in the
window, that contains the on-disk version of the file. Be sure to save the
recovered version of you file and afterwards you can safely remove the swap
file.
                                        *RecoverPluginFinish* *FinishRecovery*
In the recovered window, the command >
    :FinishRecovery
<
deletes the swapfile closes the diff window and finishes everything up.

Alternatively you can also use the command >
    :RecoveryPluginFinish
<

                                                        *RecoverPluginHelp*
The command >
    :RecoverPluginHelp
<
show a small message, on what keys can be used to move to the next different
region and how to merge the changes from one windo into the other.

                                                        *RecoverPlugin-misc*

If your Vim was built with |+balloon_eval|, recover.vim will also set up an
balloon expression, that shows you, which buffer contains the recovered
version of your file and which buffer contains the unmodified on-disk version
of your file, if you move the mouse of the buffer. (See |balloon-eval|).

If you have setup your 'statusline', recover.vim will also inject some info
(which buffer contains the on-disk version and which buffer contains the
modified, recovered version). Additionally the buffer that is read-only, will
have a filename (|:f|) of something like 'original file (on disk-version)'. If
you want to save that version, use |:saveas|.
