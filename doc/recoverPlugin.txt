Functionality

When using |recovery|, it is hard to tell, what has been changed between the
recovered file and the actual on disk version. The aim of this plugin is, to
have an easy way to see differences, between the recovered files and the files
stored on disk.

By default, it will become only active, when a swap file is detected and
enable you to see a diff of the recovered swapfile and the actual file. You
can now use the commands |:RecoveryPluginGet| (to get all differences from the
recovered swapfile) and |:RecoverPluginFinish|(to discard the swapfile
changes) and close the diff mode. Thus those two commands work to easily
discard the changes |:RecoveryPluginFinish| or to recover |:RecoveryPluginGet| 
from the swapfile.

Therefore this plugin sets up an auto command, that will create a diff buffer
between the recovered file and the on-disk version of the same file. You can
easily see, what has been changed and save your recovered work back to the
file on disk.

By default this plugin is enabled. To disable it, use >
    :RecoverPluginDisable
<
To enable this plugin again, use >
    :RecoverPluginEnable
<
When you open a file and vim detects, that an |swap-file| already exists for a
buffer, the plugin presents the default Swap-Exists dialog from Vim adding one
additional option for Diffing (but leaves out the lengthy explanation about
handling Swapfiles that Vim by default shows): >

    Found a swap file by the name "test/normal/.testfile.swp"
            owned by: chrisbra   dated: Wed Nov 28 16:26:42 2012
            file name: ~chrisbra/code/git/vim/Recover/test/normal/testfile
            modified: YES
            user name: chrisbra   host name: R500
            process ID: 4878 [not existing]
    While opening file "test/normal/testfile"
                dated: Tue Nov  6 20:11:55 2012
    Please choose:
    D[i]ff, (O)pen Read-Only, (E)dit anyway, (R)ecover, (Q)uit, (A)bort, (D)elete:


(Note, that additionally, it shows in the process ID row the name of the
process that has the process id or [not existing] if that process doesn't
exist.) Simply use the key, that is highlighted to chose the option. If you
press Ctrl-C, the default dialog of Vim will be shown.

If you have said 'Diff', the plugin opens a new vertical splitt buffer. On the
left side, you'll find the file as it is stored on disk and the right side
will contain your recovered version of the file (using the found swap file).

When you want to keep the version from the swap file, use the command ":FinishRecovery"
to close the diff view and delete the swapfile.

When you want to discard the swap file, use the command ":1,$+1diffget" in the right window,
then close the diff view and delete the swapfile with |:FinishRecovery|. You
can also use the command |:RecoveryPluginGet|, which will automatically
retrieve all changes and finish recovery.

Alternatively you can use the |merge| commands to copy selected content to the buffer
on the right that holds your recovered version. If you are finished, you can close the diff
version and close the window, by issuing |:diffoff!| and |:close| in the
window, that contains the on-disk version of the file. Be sure to save the
recovered version of you file and afterwards you can safely remove the swap
file.
                                        *:RecoverPluginFinish* *:FinishRecovery*
In the recovered buffer, the command >
    :FinishRecovery
<
deletes the swapfile closes the diff window and finishes everything up.

Alternatively you can also use the command >
    :RecoveryPluginFinish
<
                                                        *:RecoverPluginHelp*
The command >
    :RecoverPluginHelp
<
show a small message, on what keys can be used to move to the next different
region and how to merge the changes from one windo into the other.

                                                        *:RecoverPluginGet*
In the recovered buffer, the command >
    :RecoverPluginGet
<
Will get all changes from the recovered swapfile put them in the buffer and
finish diff mode off.

                                                       *RecovePlugin-config*
If you want Vim to automatically edit any file that is open in another Vim
instance but is unmodified there, you need to set the configuration variable:
g:RecoverPlugin_Edit_Unmodified to 1 like this in your |.vimrc| >

    :let g:RecoverPlugin_Edit_Unmodified = 1
<
Note: This only works on Linux.
                                                        *RecoverPlugin-misc*
If your Vim was built with |+balloon_eval|, recover.vim will also set up an
balloon expression, that shows you, which buffer contains the recovered
version of your file and which buffer contains the unmodified on-disk version
of your file, if you move the mouse of the buffer. (See |balloon-eval|).

If you have setup your 'statusline', recover.vim will also inject some info
(which buffer contains the on-disk version and which buffer contains the
modified, recovered version). Additionally the buffer that is read-only, will
have a filename (|:f|) of something like 'original file (on disk-version)'. If
you want to save that version, use |:saveas|.

3. CVIM	                                        	            	*cvim*

cvim is a python script (contributed by Marcin Szamotulski) that is
distributed together with the recoverplugin. It is located in the contrib/
folder of the plugin source (or in the contrib/ directory of your $VIMRUNTIME/
path (e.g. usually in ~/.vim/contrib) if you have installed the vimball
version of the plugin)

Usage:

cvim [-h] [-r] [-f] [-a] {directory} ...

    cvim is a python script, which can be used in a terminal to clear the
    {directory} from |swapfile|s.  Without any switches it finds all
    |swapfile|s then checks if a found |swapfile| is used by vim (using psutil
    python library).  If it is not, then it reads the |swapfile| and if the
    content matches the corresponding file it delets it.  You can get psutil
    from:
	http://code.google.com/p/psutil/

    If a file has multiple |swapfile|s left you can exit vim with |:cq| to
    preserve them all on disk or you will be asked to delete them/step through
    them.  These |swapfile|s are sorted by their modification time stamp
    (newest first).

    |cvim| works with python2.6, 2.7 and python3.3.

    The scripts accepts the following positional arguments:
    {directory}         directory where to look for swap (by default current
			directory), it can be specified multiple times.

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help           show help message and exit
    -r, -R, --recursive  search directory recursively
    -f, --find           only find and list |swapfile|s, it impiles -r
    -a, --ask            ask before deleting swap files which do not differ from
			 the file.

Note: cvim might not work on Windows.
